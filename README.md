<h1>Development & Implementation of ISO 27001 aligned InfoSec Policies</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>

- Full set of ISO 27001 compliant information security policies.

- ISMS alignment matrix mapping policies to ISO controls.

- Stakeholder approved policy documentation.

- Awareness and training rollout program.

<h2>Impact </h2>
This initiative established the institution’s first formalized information security framework, embedding ISO 27001 standards into daily operations, strengthening regulatory compliance, and building a culture of security awareness from the ground up.
